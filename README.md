# python-minecraft
control minecraft 1.16.5  using python3

## Tested one macos bigsur 11.4
i think it will run the same on ubuntu

## [Important]If you do not run python with server minecraft 1.16.5+ it's because you haven't added the plugin like me. see folder plugin 
### step 1 runserver minecraft with java 

- install java8
- clone this project
- edit config in file if you need 
- runserver with  terminal 

```
git clone https://github.com/sonnhfit/python-minecraft.git
cd python-minecraft
java -jar spigot-1.16.5.jar nogui     
```

see [folder plugin ](https://github.com/sonnhfit/python-minecraft/tree/master/plugins) because if you use new version you need copy pate plugin folder like me


### step 2
